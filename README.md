# DNABERT-2_CNN_BilSTM
DNABERT-2_CNN_BiLSTM, by integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) into the BERT model, enhances the ability to extract local features of gene sequences and capture long-range dependencies, thereby improving the predictive analysis of promoters associated with hearing loss.
